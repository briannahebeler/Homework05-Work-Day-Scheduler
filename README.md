# Homework05-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this project my goal was to create a calendar application that allows the user to save events in color-coded, hourly time slots. This application runs in the browser utilizing HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When the user opens the planner they will see the current day listed in the header of the webpage. As they scroll they will see color coded time blocks for the hours 9AM- 5PM (the traditional workday). The current time will display red, past time will display grey, and future time will display green. 

The user will be able to click in to the hourly color coded text box to enter events for the day. When they press the save button located at the end of the times row, they will be able to save their event. Their event will be saved in the webpages local storage, when they refresh the page the saved event will remain in the text box.
